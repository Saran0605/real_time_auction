# Real-Time Auction Platform 🧑‍⚖️ (MERN Stack)

This is a full-stack **Real-Time Online Auction System** built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)**. It enables users to participate in live bidding, list items for auction, and track auction status in real-time.

This project showcases my ability to build scalable and dynamic web applications using modern JavaScript frameworks and real-time communication.
